# pacman-javafx

A JavaFX user interface for my Pac-Man/Ms. Pac-Man game implementation, see [pacman-basic](https://github.com/armin-reichert/pacman-basic).

Currently, the game can only be started with the supplied batch file. Adapt the batch file to your local environment and run it as `pacman.bat`or as `pacman -mspacman`to start in Ms. Pac-Man mode. Switching between the game versions is possible from the intro scenes by pressing the "V"-key.
